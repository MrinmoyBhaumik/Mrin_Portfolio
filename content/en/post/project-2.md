title: "Predicting Kobe Bryant Shot Selection"
---

Kobe Bryant was a prolific American professional basketball player, and is considered one of the greatest players in the history of the game. We are provided with the location and circumstances of every shot attempted by Bryant during his 20-year career.

The goal of the project is twofold:
1st -	Model the data to predict whether the shot was made successfully or not on the test dataset, given the model data set.
2nd -	Provide arguments for or against following propositions
a.	The odds of Kobe making a shot decrease with respect to the distance he is from the hoop
b.	The probability of Kobe making a shot decreases linearly with respect to the distance he is from the hoop
c.	The relationship between the distance Kobe is from the basket and the odds of him making the shot is different if they are in the playoffs

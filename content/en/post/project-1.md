title: "Predicting Housing Prices in Russia"
---
Sberbank, Russiaâ€™s oldest and largest banks, wants to help their customers to make predictions about realty prices.  We are given a data set that includes 5000 properties which includes the sale price as well as 72 other features about each observation.  Our goal is to create a model that can predict the individual property prices with the data set given as accurately as possible.

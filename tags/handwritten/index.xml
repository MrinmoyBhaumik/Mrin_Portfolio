      <description>The goal of this project was to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can recognize handwriting from the first five letters in the alphabet (A,B,C,D,E). We had to use transfer learning in order to create a model that can do that. Transfer learning is when a machine learning model that is trained to solve one problem is applied to solve a different but related problem. In this scenario we used a CNN that was trained to recognize handwritten digits and applied it to recognizing handwritten letters.</description>
